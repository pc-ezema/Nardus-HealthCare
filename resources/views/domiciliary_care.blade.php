                                <p>We provide high quality generic and specialist care and support services that enable adults with a range of needs to achieve positive outcomes. We hold a wide-ranging experience of meeting the needs of adults with physical disabilities such as visual impairment, hearing impairment, chronic and debilitating health problems (HIV/AIDS), neurological disorders, and stroke-related physical disabilities. Also, we provide care and support to adults with learning disability, autistic spectrum conditions and dual diagnosis. We provide support with personal care, shopping, housing-related support and live-in support.</p>
                                <p>We recruit staff to reflect the diverse needs of service users so will continue to meet the needs of all members of the community, irrespective of race, ethnicity, gender, faith, sexuality, disability, age or class; recognising and meeting the needs of service users from Black and Minority Ethnic Community backgrounds.</p>
                                <p>Our domiciliary care service reconciles three competing aims of social care reform: personalisation, recovery and prevention. Therefore, our assessments and support planning are person-centred and focus on outcomes that leave service users better able to live well with less care. The aim is to first help people to recover their independence and then to reduce their reliance on care and stop it from increasing.<br />
